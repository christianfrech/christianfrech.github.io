My name is Christian Frech, a PhD Canddidate in Materials Science Engineering at UT Austin. My specialty is in designing multiscale frameworks to scale from highly accurate, ab-initio calculations to onger time and length scales to understand battery microstructure and electrochemistry. We aim to derive useful engineering guidelines from our simulations for experimantalists.
