My name is Christian Frech, a PhD Canddidate in Materials Science Engineering at UT Austin. I specialize designing multiscale simulation frameworks which scale from highly accurate, ab-initio calculations to longer time and length scales to understand battery microstructure and electrochemistry. We aim to derive useful engineering guidelines from our simulations for experimantalists. 

Much of my work employs kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations using an optimized in-house code for vacancy-mediated diffusion (serial and parallel versions available). I also use Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations to calculate formation energies, reaction energies, and dispersion realations.
